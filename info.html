  <h1>How To Help</h1>

  <div class="paragraph1">
    <h3>How To Help In Your Classroom</h3>
    <p> Whether you notice or not, on average 1 in 5 adults struggle with mental illnesses, and 2 of 5 students. This means that many of the people in your classroom, or work environment have a mental illness. So, how can you help? Be sensitive and careful about the things you say to others. Sometimes people are very sensitive and we are unaware of this. We may say something that’s somewhat insulting, as a joke and don’t mean it offensively. The other person however, took it seriously and it may make them feel insecure, or hurt by your words. So be sensitive. So be careful of the things you say to others, try to keep yourself from saying anything that may be negative, even if you don’t mean it hurtfully.

      Include others. Maybe you’re working on a group project, or someone is alone during your lunch waves. Ask them if they want to sit with you. Be communicative during group activities, and try to include people that seem alone. The little acts of generosity or the smiles you give to others make a change.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph2">
    <h3>How To Help In Your Work environment</h3>
    <p>  So how do I help people and create a better work environment for people around me, who may struggle with mental health issues? One thing that you can do is to make sure they feel that their role is important, and relevant. This doesn't mean that you have to go out of your way to tell them that their job is super important, but be sure to spread positivity when you have the opportunity to. Depending on the career you have, or the people around you maybe pursuing, they can get overwhelming or stressed. So be helpful. Offer to grab them their coffee, so they can stay focused, or answer any questions your colleagues may have. Much of the help that you can give is through basic ethics and being nice and generous to those around you. The main idea is to create an environment that is peaceful, and where everyone feels comfortable.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph3">
    <h3>For Friends and Family</h3>
    <p> Be there for them. Be helpful. Be communicative. Understand that their issues are something that is very hard to overcome. So make sure they know that they can contact you if they need you. Be there, for example if a family member was having a panic attack, be sure they know they can contact you. Make them feel comfortable to contact you whenever they made need, so that you can try to calm them and comfort them. Understand that having a mental health issue is completely normal, and don't treat them as vastly differently from others around them. If you feel they need it, encourage them to see a therapist, or doctor so they can receive professional assistance for their issues. Additionally, you can talk to them about their health, privately, if it’s something that you think they may want. In this situation, be sure that you are in a comfortable environment where there would be little or no interruptions. Lastly, keep what they tell you between you and them, unless they tell you otherwise. Most people would prefer to keep their mental health illnesses to themselves. So keep their information private. Majority of people don't want everyone around them knowing, because it may shift others perspective on them. Most of them wouldn’t like to be treated very differently, or pitied, so be sensitive to them when it comes to their mental health, and stability. That being said, don’t hesitate to contact someone in an emergency, or if their safety is at steak.
