      <p>I'm 17, and I will be a senior this year at Princeton High School in Princeton, NJ. I care about improving the mental health of students and adults because I have seen the effects of stress and anxiety in my peers at school and in other stressful environments. With this website, I hope to help reduce anxiety and spread positivity to all of our Keep Me Kalm users. </p>

      <p>I am 14 years old, currently going into my freshman year of high school. I have a passion for mental health disorders because I feel that it is a subject that is often times overlooked, ignored, or made out to not as big of a big deal as it is. By spreading awareness and giving resources to those who need help, we can create a better future for those who struggle with mental health issues.</p>

      <p>I am a rising freshman who has personal experience around mental health disorders so I want to help people who may struggle because I've been there and I know how it feels. Being able to share my passion for this topic with another passion of mine, coding, is an absolute dream. I hope to spread this passion onto others so that they can help create a healthier future for current generations and generations coming.</p>
